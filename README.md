This is a dumpster for my configs that actually come in use, eg. zsh prompt, environment setup, Xresources etc.

You can safely reuse these, I didn't put any personal info in there or addÂ anything sketchy - just pure *NIX configs. Use this as you wish, it's mostly just all for the sake of aesthetics.

This includes my Apple Terminal configuration, Xresources, Zsh profile and could include more in the future. Use it as you like :)
